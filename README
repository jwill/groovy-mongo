INSTALL:

You must have the mongodb-driver library on the path for your app.

USAGE:

Running MongoUtils.decorateCollectionClass() will decorate collections with the generic versions that allow passing a map for find, insert, etc. MongoUtils.decorateCollection(collectionName) will decorate a specific class instance with the dynamic finder handlers.
